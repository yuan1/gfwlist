This repository contains the plain text version of GFWList.

The Original GFWList is base64 encoded, which is quite annoying if you want to
grep or diff the content. So I created the script migrate-gfwlist.sh to decode
it and migrate the revision history. I guess the GFWList project adopted base64
encoding many years ago in order to bypass the basic packet filtering of GFW
when HTTP protocol was still popular. Since HTTPS protocol is dominant today and
no one is downloading GFWList through HTTP protocol, that is not a problem any
more. I wonder why the GFWList maintenance team still stick to base64 encoding.
